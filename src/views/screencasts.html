  I will start posting some of my screencasts here soon. I like to talk
  about concepts such as separation of concerns, testing and design patterns.

  I generally use Vue.js, TypeScript and Jest to express these things, but 
  the ideas are transferrable to any language or framework. If you are interested in seeing my content,
  you can <a href="https://vuejs-course.com/screencasts">check it out here</a>.
